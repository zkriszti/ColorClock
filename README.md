# A more interesting ColorClock

A small project for learning JS basics. 
The background changes as per a HEX value created from the string concatenation result of hours & minutes & seconds of current time. 

## Accessibility

 - designed and built to be mobile-first & responsive
 - provides both a 'wall-clock-style' and a digital representation of current time

## Built with

  - vanilla JavaScript
  - HTML5 + CSS3 
  - no external libraries used

## ToDo

 - using the library moment.js, I am planning an enhancement to display time in different time zones as well. So this would display - say - 2 more clocks, like in a stock exchange trading room.
